Web application: A confidential client running on a web server. This is the traditional server based web client accessing user data and Authorization Code Grant is the recommended flow. The Authorization Server may or may not allow Extension Grants to refresh the Access Token after it expires. The Client Credentials Grant is useful for a client to get data about itself, not associated with a specific user. In this case the client must be able to authenticate itself using only credentials it has securely stored or through some previous arrangement with the Authorization Server.
